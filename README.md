FSA Beauty Store - Design Patterns Implementation

📋 Project Overview
A comprehensive Java e-commerce platform demonstrating six design patterns working together. This project transforms theoretical pattern concepts into a functional cosmetics store with real-world architecture.

 Implemented Design Patterns
Builder Pattern - Complex Object Construction

Creates customizable beauty sets step by step
Supports different set types: Beginner, Professional, Gift sets
Manages complex object creation with multiple configurations

Decorator Pattern - Dynamic Feature Addition

Adds services to products without modifying core functionality
Includes gift wrapping, express delivery, personalization
Enables runtime service combination

Factory Pattern - Object Creation Management

Centralizes cosmetic product creation
Produces lipsticks, mascara, blush with various options
Ensures consistent product instantiation

Observer Pattern - Event Notification System

Provides real-time product change notifications
Manages customer subscriptions for stock/price updates
Supports multiple notification channels

Strategy Pattern - Interchangeable Algorithms

Implements multiple payment methods
Supports Credit Card, Apple Pay, QR payments
Enables easy addition of new payment types

Facade Pattern - Simplified System Interface

Provides unified interface to complex subsystems
Simplifies client interactions
Hides pattern complexity from end users
